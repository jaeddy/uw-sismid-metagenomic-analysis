# Motivation

In many cases it is useful to test for differential abundance
of sequences/taxa between two (or more) groups of microbiome samples.
This is inherently a multiple comparisons/testing scenario,
and so the same corrections for multiple testing that we learned in the previous section apply here. 
Many of the workflows will perform this correction by default.

# Goals of this Lab

The goal of this lab is to practice executing a few different workflows
for differential abundance multiple testing (DESeq2, edgeR, metagenomeSeq),
and combining their output into a single graphic (ggplot2, gridExtra).
