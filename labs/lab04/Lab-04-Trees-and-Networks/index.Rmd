# Motivation

As with some of the examples we saw during the lecture,
microbiome data often presents relationships among taxa or samples
that are well described by a network.
In the case of taxa, this often takes the familiar form of a tree
representing the evolutionary relationship among taxa.

# Goals of this Lab

In this lab you will learn and practice
tree manipulation,
tree visualization,
network construction and manipulation,
and network visualization.
Visualizing networks could be a workshop unto itself,
and I've provided a link to just such a workshop.

The goal of this tutorial is to get you started 
with some common tree and network visualizations
used to display, explore, and understand microbiome data.
