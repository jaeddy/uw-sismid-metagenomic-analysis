This "site" includes course materials from the UW Summer Institute course titled **Introduction to Metagenomic Data Analysis**. From the navigation menu at the top of the screen, you can browse through lab exercises (rendered as HTML from R Markdown reports) and access handouts from individual sessions.

Some of the lab solutions were provided as standard R scripts, so I'll eventually convert these to Rmd and add them to the list. Several of the lab HTML pages also included links to external resources and references &mdash; at some point, I'll try to compile these in a more organized way, but for now, I've just included a separate tab for each.

I'm not sure how long this page will stay up, but for now, you can access the course schedule and some of the lab materials here:
